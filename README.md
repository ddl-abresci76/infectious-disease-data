# Welcome to the Infectious Disease Data Project

## Getting Started:

### 1. Browse the files. You do not have to be logged in.

![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/infectious-disease-data/raw/1c9678def0304d5d545c6569309030f4dcfcf69a/scratch/fig3.png?inline=true)

### 2. [Log in](https://www.dominodatalab.com/try) if you have not already done so then navigate back to this overview either with the URL or via the search option in the upper left.

### 3. Fork this project using the button in the upper right of this screen. ![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/infectious-disease-data/raw/09475159eb92b6f56d5105deb84141ea8785ee6b/scratch/fork.png?inline=true)

### 4. In YOUR newly forked project you can scheduled jobs to refresh the source data on a daily basis.

### 7. Commit new data sources and code to process that data back into the master project. Simply add your data and code to YOUR project and then select “Request Review” from the project overview page. ![](https://try.dominodatalab.com/u/joshpoduska/infectious-disease-data/raw/28f11366e10be6347be119d637bdf6fab600ccc4/scratch/request-review-small.png?inline=true) When submitting, please give a detailed description of the data and processing code. 

## Data Descriptions:

- [2019 Novel Coronavirus Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) - Confirmed cases and 
deaths by country. Updated daily.
- [Population data](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) - Manually created csv file. Static.
- [CDC Flu View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cdcfluview/index.html) - Downloads of the most popular CDC data 
sources via the R package, cdcfluview. Updated daily.
- [Italy Flu Baseline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285#tbl0015) - Very rough estimates
of Itallian flu deaths over a four year period based on academic research models. Only max and min values for each flu
season are estimated.
- [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) - Data we all wish we had, but is too hard to find on our own. This 
group has made it a priority to track it down and consolidate it into one place. Hospitalizations, # in ICU, # on ventilators, # 
tests, and test results can be found in these data sets.

## Data in the Queue (not yet set up as an automatic refresh)

- [JHU+NYTimes+LATimes](https://covid-19.datasettes.com/)
