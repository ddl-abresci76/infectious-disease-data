# Welcome to the Infectious Disease Data Project

### The goal of this project is to provide a central repository for popular disease and health data to empower analysts and researchers.

### Browse the Files for details.

### Three scheduled jobs are setup on this project. As you are not the project owner, you cannot see them but you may want to consider creating them yourself. They are simple and run code/covid19-JHU.ipynb, code/cdcfluview.R, and  code/data_exploration_n_viz.ipynb each once a day. The first two load fresh data into the data directory under Files. The last simply creates new visualizations in the notebook.

### Data Descriptions:

- [2019 Novel Coronavirus Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) - Confirmed cases and 
deaths by country. Updated daily.
- [Population data](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) - Manually created csv file. Static.
- [CDC Flu View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cdcfluview/index.html) - Downloads of the most popular CDC data 
sources via the R package, cdcfluview. Updated daily.
- [Italy Flu Baseline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285#tbl0015) - Very rough estimates
of Itallian flu deaths over a four year period based on academic research models. Only max and min values for each flu
season are estimated.
