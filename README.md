# Welcome to the Infectious Disease Data Project

### The goal of this project is to provide a central repository for popular disease and health data to empower analysts and researchers.

### Browse the Files for details.

### Four scheduled jobs are setup on this project. As you are not the project owner, you cannot see them but you may want to consider recreating them in your forked project. Each job simply runs one of the four files under the code directory daily to download the data and visualize new graphs.

### Data Descriptions:

- [2019 Novel Coronavirus Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) - Confirmed cases and 
deaths by country. Updated daily.
- [Population data](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) - Manually created csv file. Static.
- [CDC Flu View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cdcfluview/index.html) - Downloads of the most popular CDC data 
sources via the R package, cdcfluview. Updated daily.
- [Italy Flu Baseline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285#tbl0015) - Very rough estimates
of Itallian flu deaths over a four year period based on academic research models. Only max and min values for each flu
season are estimated.
- [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) - Data we all wish we had, but is too hard to find on our own. This 
group has made it a priority to track it down and consolidate it into one place. Hospitalizations, # in ICU, # on ventilators, # 
tests, and test results can be found in these data sets.
